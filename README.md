# 🏥 Healthcare Access Inequality in the U.S.

This project explores disparities in healthcare access across U.S. counties using publicly available datasets. It focuses on how income, race, and geography affect access to primary care and insurance coverage.

## 📌 Objectives

- Identify counties with limited access to healthcare facilities
- Analyze correlations between income level and healthcare access
- Visualize uninsured rates by race and region
- Highlight geographic disparities in primary care availability

## 📊 Datasets Used

| Dataset | Source | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| CDC Social Vulnerability Index | [CDC SVI](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html) | Measures socioeconomic and demographic vulnerability |
| HRSA Health Center Data | [HRSA](https://data.hrsa.gov/) | Locations and services of federally funded health centers |
| U.S. Census Health Insurance Coverage | [Census](https://data.census.gov/) | Insurance coverage by race, income, and geography |

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL**: Data cleaning, joins, and analysis
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)**: Exploratory analysis
- **Tableau / Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and maps

## 📂 Folder Overview

- `data/`: Raw CSV files from CDC, HRSA, and Census
- `sql/`: SQL scripts for cleaning and analysis
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis
- `visualizations/`: Charts and maps generated from the analysis

## 📈 Key Insights

- Counties with high social vulnerability often lack nearby health centers
- Uninsured rates are significantly higher in rural and low-income areas
- Racial disparities persist in healthcare access, especially in Southern states
